This is a super simple mobile ui framework originally working only with webkit. Now it also works with the latest firfox browsers to. It's released under a bsd license, so you can go wild with it.

The library is dependent on Lea Vero's prefixfree library, which is released under a MIT license. 

To build the library you need to download and install grunt-cli for node and install the ruby gems for working with sass. Then just type grunt in the terminal.

At present this library works on chrome, safari and firefox but not IE!
