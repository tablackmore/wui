This is a super simple mobile ui framework originally working only with webkit. Now it also works with the latest firefox browsers to. It's released under a bsd license, so you can go wild with it.

The library is dependent on Lea Vero's prefixfree library, which is released under a MIT license. 

Build dependencies.

grunt-cli
sass compiler

Once the above are installed run npm install in the route directory to read in the grunt dependencies and then run grunt from the terminal to build and compress the source files.

To see a simple usage of the library look at demo/index.html.

At present this library works on chrome, safari and firefox but not IE!
