This is a super simple mobile webkit ui framework. It's released under a bsd license, so you can go wild with it.

To build the library 

build/make -f make_js
build/make -f make_css

The library is dependent on Matteo Spinelli iscroll library, which is released under a MIT license. http://cubiq.org/iscroll
